                  Heart Attack Prediction Backend(Initial Stage)



This is the backend for the Heart Attack Prediction App, a national-level project designed to predict heart attack risk based on user inputs (age, country, troponin I levels, and ECG heart rate) and provide tailored health plans (diet, exercise, yoga, stress management). The backend uses Node.js with Express to handle HTTP requests from a Unity frontend and a Python-based Random Forest model trained on the UCI Heart Disease dataset for predictions. This README provides instructions to set up, run, and test the backend.
